## Sample Size for Binary Logistic Prediction Models: Beyond events per variable criteria

-   clinical simulation studies for binary outcomes

    -   want accurate predictions on new data

-   *Events Per Variable* (EPV), the ratio of the number of events in the smaller class to the number of degrees of freedom

    -   think signal to noise

    -   minimum of 10 is standard

## Simulation Study

-   created more than 4,000 different combinations and over 12,000,000 datasets

    -   different combinations of EPV, event ratios, number and distribution of predictors, AUC, and predictor effects

-   7 different models

    -   Maximum Likelihood, backwards subset selection, Firth's penalized likelihood, heuristic shrinkage, Ridge, LASSO

## Our Implementation

### Questions

-   What effect does EPV have on out-of-sample prediction for logistic regression?

-   What effect does EPV have on out-of-sample prediction for non-parametric methods of binary classification?

-   Are there metrics that better estimate out-of-sample prediction? If so, which ones?
