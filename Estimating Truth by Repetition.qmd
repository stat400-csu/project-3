Sample size for binary logistic prediction models: beyond events per variable criteria, Maarten et. al

*Statistical Methods in Medical Research*

## Abstract

<br>

Logistic regression is often used in clinical settings.

-   Long-held standard is to use EPV (events per variable) ≥ 10 to decide minimum sample size & maximum number of predictors to use in a study.

-   Events per variable is a ratio of the number of events / number of predictors.

Simulation study:

-   studies the influence of EPV, the events fraction, & the number of possible predictors

-   predictive performance of correlations, distributions of possible predictor variables, & predictor effects on new simulated sample data are compared

Comparison methods:

-   rMPSE

-   calibration slope

-   AUC

Outcome:

-   research study indicates that EPV does not have a strong relation with the metrics of predictive performance

-   suggest using 3 factors instead: number of predictors, total sample size, & the events fraction (a ratio of positive outcomes over the total outcomes)
