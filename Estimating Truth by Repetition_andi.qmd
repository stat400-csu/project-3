## Research Study 

<<<<<<< HEAD
<br>

Sample size for binary logistic prediction models: beyond events per variable criteria, Maarten et. al

*Statistical Methods in Medical Research*

## Abstract

<br>

Logistic regression is often used in clinical settings.

-   Long-held standard is to use EPV (events per variable) ≥ 10 to decide minimum sample size & maximum number of predictors to use in a study.

-   Events per variable is a ratio of the number of events / number of predictors.

Simulation study:

-   studies the influence of EPV, the events fraction, & the number of possible predictors

-   predictive performance of correlations, distributions of possible predictor variables, & predictor effects on new simulated sample data are compared

Comparison methods:

-   rMPSE

-   calibration slope

-   AUC

Outcome:

-   research study indicates that EPV does not have a strong relation with the metrics of predictive performance

-   suggest using 3 factors instead: number of predictors, total sample size, & the events fraction (a ratio of positive outcomes over the total outcomes)
=======
-   clinical simulation studies for binary outcomes

    -   want accurate predictions on new data

-   *Events Per Variable* (EPV), the ratio of the number of events in the smaller class to the number of degrees of freedom

    -   think signal to noise

    -   minimum of 10 is standard

## Simulation Study

-   created more than 4,000 different combinations and over 12,000,000 datasets

    -   different combinations of EPV, event ratios, number and distribution of predictors, AUC, and predictor effects

-   7 different models

    -   Maximum Likelihood, backwards subset selection, Firth's penalized likelihood, heuristic shrinkage, Ridge, LASSO

## Our Implementation

### Questions

-   What effect does EPV have on out-of-sample prediction for logistic regression?

-   What effect does EPV have on out-of-sample prediction for non-parametric methods of binary classification?

-   Are there metrics that better estimate out-of-sample prediction? If so, which ones?
